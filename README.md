# LifeOS

> **A modular AI-powered personal operating system built with n8n, Supabase, and Telegram.**

LifeOS is an event-driven automation platform that centralizes task management, personal organization, and future AI-powered productivity into a single extensible system.

Instead of building isolated automation workflows, LifeOS is designed as a scalable operating system where independent modules communicate through a standardized architecture.
